This code is supposed to take a quote of the users choice and scroll it
over the top row of the LCD while also having my name displayed on the 
bottom row of the LCD(the name cannot scroll with quote). In order to 
make only the top row scroll, I needed to create some if statements to 
handle certain conditions, such as: characters 0-15, the end character,
whether or not to start over in the string, or if it prints the entire string.
After it scrolls through the first row, it will print out the name at the 
bottom while being centered.
